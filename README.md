I develop an Android App for check employees’ day by day attendance through this application.
And It have user and admin control site. Admin can Insert, Update, Delete and View.

First, we need to register with correct EPF number with employee’s details.

After login, the system using EPF number with password and it will move to user home page.
User home page have 6 links (Check-in, check-out, Edit Profile, Logout, View Check-in Recordes, View Check-out Recordes)

Check in and Check out pages auto generate our Location and Co-ordinates. so, we make our attendance easily.

Admin can view employee’s details and employee’s day by day attendance.
